# FractionalNFT
## Explaning FNFT.sol
Fractionalized NFTs are writing the next chapter in the fast-growing crypto, blockchain, and decentralisation industry. The process of splitting ownership of an NFT into smaller fractions is known as NFT fractionalization. As a result, several persons may possess a single NFT.Given that an NFT, unlike a cryptocurrency, is a non-fungible token, meaning it cannot be exchanged for any other asset of its likeness, fractional NFTs push the boundaries by making it possible to divide ownership of an NFT. For instance, if you have the original painting of the famous Mona Lisa, not only is it impossible to exchange that painting for another type of painting, but it is also impossible to divide that painting into smaller pieces.
We will use Ethereum’s ERC20 and ERC721 token development standards to illustrate how fractionalized NFTs work. As a reminder, ERC721 tokens are the set standard for creating non-fungible tokens on Ethereum’s blockchain, and the ERC20 standard is used to create fungible tokens. A fungible token could be created to represent fungible items such as gold, money, or any other commodity in the physical world. A non-fungible token on the other hand can be used to represent any rare item such as a collectible game card, a trophy, or a house.
Given that a fungible token is flexible such that it can be exchanged for another of its kind without losing value, a smart contract can be deployed to generate ERC20 tokens linked to an indivisible ERC721 NFT. This way, anyone who holds any of the ERC20 tokens generated can own a percentage of the rare and valuable NFT.This is how fractional ownership of an NFT can be created, and the smart contract can secure the data that differentiates the fractional NFT from other NFTs. This idea can also be applied on any blockchain network that supports smart contracts and NFTs such that the NFT is locked in a smart contract on the blockchain and ownership of the NFT is represented by multiple fungible tokens whose supply is governed by the smart contract.
